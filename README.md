My extension

This Chrome extension provides users with weather information, location details, exact time, and amusing facts about various types of spells in the Harry Potter universe. The project was initially started as part of a course on Scrimba but was continued independently. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with data being fetched to populate the content.

You will need a web server to run this to go around CORS limitations.
